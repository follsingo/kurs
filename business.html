                            <h2>Four steps to buy business insurance</h2>
                            <p>Assess your risks. Think about what kind of accidents, natural disasters, or lawsuits could damage your business. For example, if your business is located in a commercial area that is at risk from seasonal events such as fire or hail storms, commercial property insurance will help protect against loss.</p>
                            <p>Find a reputable licensed agent. Commercial insurance agents can help you find policies that match your business needs. They receive commissions from insurance companies when they sell policies, so it's important to find a licensed agent that’s interested in your needs as much as his or her own.</p>
                            <p>Shop around. Prices and benefits can vary significantly. You should compare rates, terms, and benefits for insurance offers from several different agents.</p>
                            <p>Re-assess every year. As your business grows, so do your liabilities. If you have purchased or replaced equipment or expanded operations, you should contact your insurance agent to discuss changes in your business and how they affect your coverage.</p>
